How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

To interpret and implement the user needs into a program i would first start by performing an analysis and completing the agile team charter form that includes such items as business vision, mission statement, success criteria, project risks, rules of behavior and communication. From there i would create a product backlog from the information we received from the client. The product backlog contains a prioritized level user story list. Once we have the priorioty list we could breakdown the user stories further creating User Story Details and including a user story value statement and acceptance criteria.
User stories can be extremely helpful in helping the Scrum Team deliver the highest value by focusing on the small and immediate customer needs. The Product Owner uses the user stories and actively prioritizes them in terms of user value, risk, and business value to significantly increase the value delivered by the scrum team. With user stories, the product is built incrementally, with an option being having the ability to change directions and add or remove features. As the product continues to incrementally grow the value of the product keeps increasing.


How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

So far up until this point in my career i have not had to develop any programs, but there are many strategies that could be used to in poject development. In this class we were taught about agile and its benefits when comared to waterfall. Any approach to development is based on what methodology your current company uses, and while each has its benefits and drawbacks choosing an approach comes down to team size, budgets, client needs and expectations. If i were to use agile, the processes i would incoporate into my development would be to use Scrum. We know that Scrum includes daily scrum meetings, sprints, and utilizes a product backlog to complete the tasks and user stories based on priority. Agile provides the tools to create an organized team that is flexible and adaptable with the team based focus on providing quality software. When using Scrum, we could use one of the many software tools available to help track the status of each development project, by using Azure, or Jira just to name a few. 




What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

I believe a good team member is someone who has the ability to communicate openly with other members od the team. Everyone has a different opinion, social background, ethnic background, political views etc., but within a team putting that aside and having an open line of communication ensures that the team is succesful. Another principle that i believe makes a good team member is showing respect to others under every circumstance, which helps in creating a strong foundation at any comnpany built on trust and respect. Finally i believe that a good team member should hold themselves accountable for all their actions and for any work they perform. If a team knows what to expect from other members this creates a high performing team where every member is able to equally carry the weight.
